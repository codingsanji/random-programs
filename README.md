<h2>Random-Programs</h2>
<h3>As the name implies, I sorted a collection of my own programs based on the languages indicated in the folder names. In addition to various programs, you might stumble upon some solutions to LeetCode problems but you'll see that these are mostly beginner projects meant for practice and language learning in general. I'll continue to keep them here as a reference point for myself :) </h3>

<h4>Fr tho let's pray that the code works right for all test cases and I didn't miss something</h4>
